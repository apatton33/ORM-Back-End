# ORM-Back-End

## Description

```md
my task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
```

## Usage

```md
The user is  able to connect to a database using Sequelize
and enter schema and seed commands to create a development database that is 
seeded with test data.Then the user can invoke the application
by starting the server.js. They will then be able open API GET routes 
in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags.
The data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
and able to test the create, update, and delete in the database and routes.
